                    it scrapes live data from Falmouth Uni’s website to determine:
                    <ul>
                        <li> Whether services (shops, cafes, gyms) are open or closed </li>

                    This data is then formatted depending on the user’s request and then fed back to the user through the correct discord channel.

            <h1> Guitar Controller Game </h1>
        </div>
        <div class="infoAlign">
        <p>
            For my first year module, comp140, 
            I made a game controller out of an old accustic guitar. The pitch is that you can place your finger down on the neck of a guitar, 
            using real wood and real strings, 
            and that would register in a “guitar hero like” game as you playing that certain note. 
            <br><br>The uniqueness comes from not having anybuttons but an actual guitar. 
            It was linked through and ardunio conneting to a unity project containing the game. 
        </p>
        <p>The guitar controller worked as a large potential divider circuit, 
            where each string was a pin into the ardino and each fret was between a different resistor.
            A different potential difference would be recorded depending on the fret, which the user played. 
            This would pick up in the game as a note.
            <br><br>
            In the game, I wrote a mapping system for songs, including relivant song and note infomation, 
            so that you could map out anysong to be played. 
            The project took an OOP approach and ran parallel to the arduni code.

        <div class="infoAlign">
        <p>
            <b>Snappy Kanji</b> allows you to practiceyou knowledge of different kanji through using pre-made collections, 
            taken from JLPT levels or your own custom scripts. 
            Its a prototype project I wrote when I first started learning Japanese.
            <br><br>
            I ran into the issue, like many other learners do, of having to tackle thousands of unique kanji 
            (logographic characters taken from Chinese script) and their different readings.             
            The idea was inspired by the website, https://realkana.com/, 
            which i had used to learn hiragana and katakana, the other two Japanese scripts.
        </p>
        <p>
            I use https://kanjiapi.dev/ to extract relivant data about kanjis and to load them into sets, 
            whether pre-made or dynamically made by the user. 
            The data is stored in JSON files and accessed live.
            <br><br>
            The user has to write the correct reading of the kanji with their score being displayed.
            The user can choose to be tested on On or Yom readings or both.
