            <h2>Background Review</h2>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>This study will investigate the practicality of using large-language
                models to generate Python code. These models take in a human-
                written prompt to generate an output, the output attempting to
                fulfil the desired task of the prompt through code. Within the last
                few years, these models have been used to generate code in many
                programming languages, straight into a programmer’s IDE. With
                many large tech companies investing in generative models, such as
                Google and META [ <a class="source" href="https://ai.meta.com/llama/">20</a>, <a class="source" href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/bard-google-ai-search-updates/">28</a>], and bespoke versions of these models
                being used commercially for code productivity, such as Github’s
                Copilot and Sourcery [ <a class="source" href="https://github.com/features/copilot">22</a> , <a class="source" href="https://sourcery.ai/">25</a>], their use by programmers is rapidly
                increasing. LLM are often described as a black box, this describes
                how the user can input data and receive a response, without an
                understanding of the internals. 
                <br><br>        
                This form of abstraction is very com-
                mon within programming, however, where LLM stand out is that
                the engineers behind them also do not know. Because the internal
                ’synapses’ of the neural network are automatically arranged by the
                model itself, it’s extremely difficult for an engineer to decipher. Due
                to this black box behaviour, an intimate understanding of how these
                code snippets are generated is unknown, and there’s a risk that 
                poorly written, buggy and insecure code could be used by novice
                and experienced programmers alike. The need to understand the
                level of quality of outputs is paramount before these generation
                tools become widespread in education and industry, so the conse-
                quences can be best understood. The focus of this study will
                be on Open-AI’s GPT models due to their API, success and public
                prominence.</p>
            <h3>Understanding Code Generation</h3>
            <p>Code generation is not new, being used in many computing pro-
                cesses already, perhaps most well-known is the use in compilers to
                produce code optimisation and executable machine code. Further-
                more, code generation from a human prompt has been discussed for
                over 50 years. PROW [<a class="source" href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/PROW%3A-A-Step-Toward-Automatic-Program-Writing-Waldinger-Lee/577e96521d62b9ebb5fd67412a21b02e9cd67b90">35</a>] was an early code generation tool that
                could produce Perl code from an input written in predicate calculus.
                However, as discussed two years later by Manna and Waldinger
                [ <a class="source" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/362566.362568">18</a> ], "programmers might find such a language lacking in read-
                ability and conciseness." They went on to predict a future program
                synthesizer; one that works with the programmer to produce seg-
                ments of code that can be incorporated into the program. They
                argue it would be a "more practical system" with greater "power".
                Fifty years later in 2022, with the public release of ChatGPT [ <a class="source" href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes#h_4799933861">24</a> ],
                public awareness of LLM significantly increased due to the wide
                adaption of its chat feature. Generation models have been used
                for years to write essays, generate art and synthesise an actor’s
                voice, the implications of such have caused many to re-evaluate the
                current state and future of educational and business environments
                [ 7, 10 , 16 , 37 ], but more recently the use of generation has become
                more relevant in a programmer’s workflow.</p>
            <h3>The Background of LLM</h3>
            <p>The rising popularity of LLM generation is in-large due to their
                apparent success at task completion, giving them the appearance
                of being intelligent. However, by any definition today, at most it’s
                pseudo-intelligence. This section will first give a very brief overview
                of the workings of LLM, why they’re pseudo-intellectual and then
                their current use today.
                Large language models are neural networks trained to predict the
                next token in a sequence, the token, in the case of code generation,
                being characters in a string.
                <br><br>
                GPT stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer. The genera-
                tion means that it can predict the next token, pre-trained means
                that the model has received a large amount of data and has had its
                bias adjusted and a transformer is an encoder-decoder network that
                adds self-attention. Self-attention results in significant performance
                increases in accurate prediction. LLM that have been pre-trained
                can be further fine-tuned to improve performance at specific predic-
                tions. Although the prediction can be extremely accurate, there is
                no logical reasoning behind the prediction that can be seen as akin
                to human intelligence. The accurate predictions serve to mimic
                human intelligence.<br><br>
                In 2021 OpenAI released their fine-tuned model GPT-3 codex,
                trained on 54 million public software repositories hosted on GitHub
                [ 4]. Released the same year [22], Github’s CoPilot is a generation
                model with a heavy reliance on Codex. To test the functional perfor-
                mance of Codex, the team behind OpenAI released the humanEval
                data set. A public repository to benchmark the performance of
                generated code. They also implemented the technique pass@k, the
                formula for which can be seen in the appendix section .3. An unbi-
                ased calculator to estimate the success of a model given k samples.
                Functional performance is found by the ability to generate code
                from a prompt that successfully passes given unit tests, failures
                often due to syntax errors, invoking out-of-scope functions or ref-
                erencing non-existent variables. Within their data set, Codex had a
                higher performance than all previous GPT-model, solving 70.2% of
                problems with 100 samples. The functional performance of Codex
                and models alike have been replicated numerously [26 , 29 , 38 , 40 ],
                with Codex being able to outperform students in even CS1 ques-
                tions and, although performance dropped, still compete with stu-
                dents in CS2 questions [9]. CS1 questions covered the basics of
                programming, with topics such as "variables, arithmetic, condi-
                tional branches, loops, reading and writing to files, and functions".
                CS2 took questions further, covering questions about hashing, dis-
                crete mathematics, OOP and ADTs. During these questions, the
                model could recognise algorithms by name and produce efficient
                solutions for those problems, such as tree or graph searches and
                modifications.
            </p>
            <h3>Issues With The Current State of Code Generation</h3>
            <p>Large language models have proven to appear highly performant,
                however, several technical and practical limitations should be care-
                fully understood.<br><br>
                Firstly, models are not uniform across languages. Nguyen and
                Nadi [ 26 ] found that CoPilot functionally performed best when
                writing in Java and worst in Javascript. Other researchers have
                written their own fine-tuned model, Poly-Coder, based on the GPT-
                2 architecture, which outperforms all GPT-based models in the C
                language [ 40 ]. Its was argued that the low score in C was possibly
                due to a problem with the data-set and fine-tuning process being
                over-reliant on Python and under focused in C.<br><br>
                Secondly, the results are not one-shot. Codex can respond with
                very variant accuracy in its solutions, hence why most investiga-
                tions use several responses, such as with pass@k often using 100
                samples. This is not the standard programming experience; a stu-
                dent does not submit 100 solutions to be marked by their professor,
                leading to the comparison being fallacious. An attempt to control
                this compared students to Codex, except also gave students multiple
                attempts at solutions, their success frequently increases with each
                attempt. However, they found that Codex was still competitive with
                students, even after multiple submissions [9].<br><br>
                Thirdly, responses vary significantly depending on the value of
                the model’s temperature. Temperature is a value used in neural net-
                works to increase entropy (effectively randomness) in the softmax
                distribution, the distribution which controls the quality and diver-
                sity of the predictions. This affects the output layer where tokens
                are sampled from. A higher temperature increases how ’surprising’
                the next token will be [ 12, 36 ]. Multiple studies have found that
                with a higher temperature, models can achieve a higher pass@k
                score at larger samples, despite producing more erroneous code.
                Across multiple studies, researchers found optimal performance at
                T0.6, with T0.2 and T0.8 also performing well. Temperature and
                sample size were found to be proportional, this is likely due to the
                diversity of code at higher temperatures needing a higher sample
                rate to score [4, 27, 40].<br><br>
                Fourthly, there is a significant reason to question whether the
                success of generated code translates into actual programmer perfor-
                mance, even with their access becoming more streamlined. CoPilot
                can directly embed into your IDE, finishing off lines or blocks of
                code for the user. There is also a chat option in VS Code where
                prompts can be given and code can be directly copied into the user’s
                file, currently in beta. However, when a programmer uses a piece of
                code, they have to evaluate the code before use as it might contain
                bugs, be a sub-optimal solution or generally poorly written. In a
                study of 24 participants using Copilot [34], they found that even
                though code generation gave promising results, it did not improve
                overall programming time or the success rate of those participants
                using the tool. CoPilot even led to more task failures in the medium
                and hard category of tasks, where programmers might have not
                understood the generated code or spent longer debugging the code
                than if they had just written it themselves. Nevertheless, 23/24 of
                the participants still found it more useful than Intellisense and the
                majority "overwhelmingly preferred using Copilot in their program-
                ming workflow since Copilot often provided a good starting point
                to approach the programming task."
                <br><br>
                The study showed CoPilot to be an imperfect aid. It can allow a programmer to instantly gener-
                ate an often feasible solution to a task, however, in doing so they
                remove themselves from the task of problem-solving, which often
                exposes the programmer to online discussion and related topics,
                advancing their technical skill. Other researchers have discussed
                this problem, hypothesising that code generation is an efficient tool
                for seasoned programmers, but can turn into a liability when used
                by novice programmers who do not fully understand the problem,
                context and generated solution [23].</p>
                <h3>Quality Code</h3>
                <p>Good quality code is vital for creating maintainable software that
                    can last, but still, there is discourse around what good quality code
                    is. In 1969 Dijkstra wrote in a letter, "A programmer has only done a
                    decent job when his program is flawless and not when his program is
                    functioning properly only most of the time." He criticized the attitude
                    of programmers of his time, something that he saw as a "software
                    crisis". He saw programmers treating debugging as a necessity,
                    rather than what he believed, an inevitable consequence of poorly
                    written systems. He argued that writing "intellectually manageable"
                    programs would reduce the amount of reasoning involved in jus-
                    tifying their proper operation and a reduction in the number of
                    test cases. If done correctly, he claims that "the correctness can be
                    shown a priori", so a need for zero test cases. Dijkstra laid out a
                    fundamental argument for why quality code is necessary which
                    has been built upon ever since [6].<br><br>
                    Recognising when code is "intellectually manageable" is a com-
                    plex issue. Greg Michaelson wrote that "Programming style is no-
                    toriously difficult to characterise" and that imperative languages
                    have been the "source of endless theological disputes", such as the
                    use of GOTOS, the use of recursion over iteration or the number
                    of parameters a sub-program should have [21 ]. While for the most
                    part, experts agree on the abandonment of goto’s in structured
                    programming [5, 15], the rest are still up for debate.
                    The quality of generated code is vital if the produced code is
                    ever expected to be used in a practical sense. However, the common
                    mantra, garbage in, garbage out is just as true now, the quality of
                    written code largely depends on the quality of the code within the
                    data set. Unfortunately, the fine details of the data sets used for
                    available LLM are kept private, [ 40], so to assess the quality of code,
                    we can use code metrics as an attempt to judge the outputted code.</p>
                    <h3>Code Analysis</h3>
                    <div>
                    <p>
                    Pre-1980, software metrics generally worked as a regression model
                    between two variables, conceptually simple, mostly relying on
                    resources and quality. However, during the mid-late 70s, software
                    metrics saw a new direction with Halstead and McCabe [ 8 ]. They
                    extracted information from the code design rather than just the
                    static code.
                    Halstead developed a set of formulas that, when given a code
                    input, would produce a series of scores based on the number of
                    unique and total amount of operands and operators used [17 ]. The
                    definition of Operands and Operators has slightly different mean-
                    ings depending on the implementation, but generally, operators
                    are all normal operators, keywords and brackets of all kinds ( (),
                    [], ). Operands are variables, methods or function declarations
                    and constants such as Boolean values and strings. Halstead metrics
                    produce useful scores of the complexity of code, such as an esti-
                    mate of the time to program and the potential for bugs. Although
                    Halstead metrics are not free from critique, various definitions can
                    cause trouble when comparing scores, the use of magic numbers (18
                    appearing in the Time formula) appears to be arbitrary and it can
                    be argued that the use of operands and operators is too simplistic
                    for modern programming.<br><br>
                    Other code metrics take different approaches to Halstead to
                    achieve the same goal of scoring code. The Flesch-Kincaid readabil-
                    ity test [ 14 ] is a method to score the readability of human written
                    language, based on the number of syllables per words and words
                    per sentence, similar to how Halstead used operators and operands.
                    Kurt Starsinic developed a module, Fathom.pm, to apply the Fleshc-
                    Kincaid test to Perl code, producing a score based on the number
                    of tokens per expression, expressions per statement and statements
                    per subroutine [32].<br><br>
                    The formula would produce a score from 1 - 7, where 5 is "Trival"
                    and 7 is "Very Hairy". However, he did not provide any justification
                    for the weights used in the formula except that they were fined-
                    tuned through trial and error. Börstler, Caspersen and Nordström
                    would later produce a similar metric method to Starsinic, while
                    also using the FLesch-Kincaid test. They introduced the Software
                    Readability Ease Score (SRES) by treating the "lexemes of a pro-
                    gramming language as syllables, its statements as words, and its
                    units of abstraction as sentences" [ 2]. They argued that this type
                    of static code analysis was a clear indicator of how readable, and
                    thus maintainable the code was. However, to quote Dijkstra, other
                    factors affect the "goodness" of code, such as control flow.
                    In 1976, McCabe proposed a technique called Cyclomatic com-
                    plexity for scoring the control flow a program takes [ 19 ]. This was
                    an attempt to "provide a quantitative basis for modularization" as a
                    way to identify in advance modules which will be difficult to main-
                    tain. McCabe provides the definition "Definition 1: The cyclomatic
                    number V(G) of a graph G with n vertices, e edges, and p connected
                    components is <br><br>
                    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
                        𝑣 (𝐺) = 𝑒 − 𝑛 + 𝑝
                    </div>
                    <br><br>
                    Cyclomatic complexity can be viewed as building up graphs from
                    smaller components, examples of which McCabe included.

                    </figure>    
                    However, Cyclomatic complexity does not handle all the intri-
                    cacies of code, especially since it does not consider else, do & try,
                    object creation and method calls. Furthermore, there are different
                    interpretations of the method, with some researchers testing com-
                    plexity at only a module level, while others at a program level,
                    summing up the scores of individual modules. This inconsistency
                    disrupts the comparison of results [ 30 , 39 ]. While none of these
                    metrics are perfect estimates of complexity, they allow for fast,
                    accurate judgment of code. Halstead and McCabe developed their
                    metrics during an era of batch programming where systems were
                    significantly smaller today. While they may be ill-suited for large,
                    industrial software, this makes them the perfect solution to mea-
                    suring smaller, generated code pieces which inherently lack the
                    complexity in which these metrics can not accurately judge [31].
                    To accurately ascertain a meaningful judgement of code quality,
                    several measurements must be taken that account for the com-
                    plexity of each line and the path the code can take throughout   
                    he program. This approach of using code metrics to judge LLM
                    generation is sparse in the current field of research [ 23 , 26 ], with
                    researchers focusing on functional performance. The practicality
                    of code generation relies in large part on the maintainability of
                    the code, not just its functional performance, and requires better
                    understanding.

                        The study will compare the Halstead metrics scores between two groups of code samples,
                        gpt-generated and human. 5 problems/samples, with 5 human written answers and 500
                        generated, 100 per sample, using the model gpt-3.5. <br><br> 
                        For each problem, gpt3.5 generates 100 solutions, were then the metric are calculated and 
                        averaged to produce one score per problem. For each human answer, the Halstead score
                        is calculated per sample.

                        <h4>Stats</h4>
                        To test the null hypotheses, an independent sample
                        1-tailed t-Test was used to compare the GPT and human groups. This test
                        is a parametric test that compares whether there is a statistically
                        significant difference between the two groups’ means.<br>
                        T-Tests can only be used to test data that is normally distributed, so
                        a Shapiro test is used to ensure this before further analysis.

                            The difference is calculated by human score - gpt score. The lower the score, the better the metric. 
                            Red scores mean that the human score was lower than the gpt score, meaning that the human code was rated better.
                            Overall, gpt generations scores 436.6 total points higher than human answers.<br>
                            The results show that gpt3.5 can generate code successfully, that produces competitive results to human answers.
                            However, human results still scored higher.
                            <br><br>
                            Performing the T-Test showed that the alternative hypotheses was true only with a P-Value of
                            0.5. With such as high P-value, the results are not statistically significant and 
                            the null hypotheses cannot be rejected. However, the results are promising, since generated code
                            did score lower for some problems, showing that gpt3.5 can generate code that is competitive with human answers.
